# LiFiTransmission
Demonstrate working of message transmission using visible light and its future potential in communication
his project demonstrates a simple and effective implementation of Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) communication using an ESP8266 microcontroller, LED transmitter, and LDR-based receiver. Binary-encoded text is transmitted via visible light and decoded on the receiver end, where the recovered message is displayed on a 16x2 I2C LCD.

ðŸ”§ Features
One-way data transmission using light (Li-Fi)

ESP8266 NodeMCU used as the transmitter microcontroller

Binary encoding of characters with start and stop bit framing

LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) detects binary pulses of light

Real-time text display on a 16x2 I2C LCD module

Low-cost and easy-to-build setup for basic Li-Fi experiments

ðŸ“¦ Components Used
